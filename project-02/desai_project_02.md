# Data Visualization Mini Project 2

## Mini-Project 2

#### For this mini-project, I have planned to create three different visualizations to explore various aspects US Birth counts and lakes in Florida:

<br/>

##### **1. Interactive Chart of Monthly Birth Counts and Trends**

The purpose of this chart was to give a summary of Monthly birth counts and yearly trends.

##### **2. Spatial Visualization**

The purpose of this visualization was to illustrate the lakes in Florida map.

##### **3. Scatter Plot to analyze trends and predictions**

The objective of this chart was to examine the overall yearly trends in birth counts throughout the Dataset' s time span.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### With these plots I have planned to tell a comprehensive story about the US Birth Data analysis and the lakes in Florida.

<br/>

##### **1.** Interactive Visualization of US Monthly Birth Data (2000-2014)

An interesting method to examine patterns in birth numbers from 2000 to 2014 is to examine the interactive plot of US monthly birth statistics. Users can get comprehensive details on the number of births for each month and year by hovering over each data point. It is simple to see key trends over the period, annual fluctuations, and seasonal patterns via this dynamic illustration.

##### **2. Lakes in Florida**

The "Lakes in Florida" plot offers a thorough visual representation of the many lakes scattered around the state. This visualization provides information about the locations and sizes of lakes by highlighting their geographic distribution and density through the use of spatial data. This map, which shows regions with larger numbers of lakes and their proximity to other geographical features, aids in understanding the topography of Florida's natural water bodies. Utilizing the abundant water resources of the state, it is a valuable tool for recreational, urban development, and environmental studies.

##### **3. Analyzing Trends in US Birth Data: Visualizations, Linear Model, and Predictions**

The trend in the total number of births in the US over various years shown in the "Linear Model: Total Births Over Years" plot. This graphic indicates if there is a trend toward an increase or decrease in the number of births over time by fitting a linear model to the data. The total number of births for each year is represented by each data point, and the line of best fit makes the general trend's intensity and direction easier to see.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### One of the challenge I have faced is to display month name on hover of the interactive plot.

#### I have applied few key principles of data visualization.

<br/>

##### **1. Use of minimal themes to focus on data.**

##### **2. Interactive elements to engage users.**

##### **3. Consistent color schemes and clear annotations.**
