# Data Visualization

## Mini-Project 1



#### For this mini-project, I have planned to create three different visualizations to explore various aspects of World Cup match data:
<br/>

##### **1. Bar Chart of Overall total match outcomes**
The purpose of this chart was to give a summary of all the matches that were played and their results. The idea was to use color to clearly distinguish between the match results

##### **2. Scatter Plot and Line Chart of Average Goals per Match Across World Cup Years**
The purpose of this visualization was to illustrate the average goals scored per game trend across several World Cup years. The idea was to draw attention to changes and trends over time by employing points and linking them with lines.

##### **3. Bar Chart of Average Home and Away Goals per Match Across World Cup Years**
The purpose of this chart was to compare the average goals scored by home and away teams during various World Cup years. The goal of the side-by-side bar chart format was to highlight the variations and parallels in the scoring patterns for home and away teams.

#### With these plots I have planned to tell a comprehensive story about the dybamics of the World Cup Matches, focusing on results and scoring trends.
<br/>

##### **1. Overall total match results**
This chart reveals the total number of match results in wining, losing and draws. This information could help identify any dominant trends or patterns in match results, potentially highlighting the competitive nature of World Cup matches.

##### **2. Average Goals per Match Across World Cup Years**
This chart illustrate the trends in scoring over various World Cup years. This could tell about how the style of game might have evolved over time, with periods of higher or lower average goals per match indicating changes in strategies, rules, or the overall competitiveness of the World Cup

##### **3. Average Home and Away Goals per Match Across World Cup Years**
This chart compares the home and away teams' scoring efficiency across various Wold Cups. This could reveal fascinating trends, such if away teams do equally well or if home teams always have the upper hand. It would give a clearer picture of how team performance is affected by match location.

#### I have applied few key principles of data visualization.

<br/>

##### **1. Appropriate Chart Selection:**

+ **Bar Charts for Categorical Data:** Bar charts were chosen to represent categorical data such as match outcomes and average goals per match. This choice was made because bar charts effectively display differences between categories, making it easy to compare totals and averages.

+ **Scatter Plot with Line Chart for Trend Analysis:** A scatter plot combined with a line chart was used to visualize the average goals per match over different World Cup years. This combination highlights both individual data points and the overall trend, providing a clear picture of how scoring patterns have evolved over time.

##### **2. Simplicity, Consistency, and Clarity with `theme_minimal()`:**

+ **Simplicity:** The `theme_minimal()` function was applied to all plots to strip away unnecessary elements, ensuring that the focus remained on the data itself.

+ **Consistency:** Using the same theme across all visualizations ensured a uniform look and feel, which helped in maintaining visual coherence and professionalism.

+ **Clarity:** The minimalist design reduced visual clutter, making the charts easier to read and understand, thus enhancing the overall clarity of the data presentation.

##### **3. Effective Use of Colors:**

+ **Bar Chart Colors:** Distinct colors were assigned to different categories in the bar charts to make them easily distinguishable. For example, specific colors were used for home and away goals to clearly differentiate between them.

+ **Line Chart Colors:** Colors were also used in the scatter plot and line chart to differentiate between years, ensuring that trends over time were easy to follow.


##### **4. Legend Position Adjustment:**

+ **Over sized Content:** The legend was adjusted in terms of position to handle oversized content effectively. By placing the legend at the bottom and formatting it to fit horizontally, it avoided overlapping with the chart and ensured that it was both readable and accessible.

##### **5. Proper Axis and Legends Labeling**

+ **X-Axis Labels:** Descriptive and appropriate names were given to the x-axis labels to clearly indicate what data was being represented. For instance, "World Cup Year" was used to denote the years in the trend analysis chart.

+ **Y-Axis Labels:** Similarly, the y-axis labels were named accurately to reflect the data being measured, such as "Total Matches" or "Average Goals". This ensured that viewers could easily understand the metrics being displayed without ambiguity.
